Gameplay Overview
1. Definitions
Run: Any attempt at progressing through the game.
Completed Run: A run in which the player defeats the 10th boss.
2. New Game Setup
Hero Selection & Movement Ability
Hero Selection:
The player chooses one hero at the start.
Pawn is available by default; the other heroes (Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, King) unlock via specific run completion conditions.
Each hero provides a unique Movement Ability that is inherent and fixed for that run.
Ability Selection
After choosing a hero, the player is taken to the Ability Selection screen to pick one ability for each of the following four slots: Primary, Secondary, Special, and Passive.
The Movement Ability Slot is determined by the chosen hero and is not selectable.
Initially, only one option per slot is unlocked; additional abilities become available as you progress.
Note: With the removal of Boss Tokens, hovering over an ability now simply shows its details (such as damage, cooldown, etc.) rather than a cost.
3. Lobby
Layout: A 3×3 grid room with the player starting at the center tile.
Boss Doors: Three doors are located at the center-left, center-right, and center-top tiles.
Lobby UI: Displays your current abilities (which are not active in the lobby).
Healing: There is no automatic healing on entering the lobby. Healing is now only possible by choosing the heal option during the post-boss upgrade phase.
4. Boss Rooms & Boss Setup
Boss Generation:
Each boss is randomly selected from the same pool of hero classes as the player.
The chosen class determines the boss’s Movement Ability.
The boss is assigned one random ability per slot (Primary, Secondary, Special, and Passive).
5. Boss Fight & Upgrade Mechanics
Combat:

Fights are turn-based (see “Turn Structure & Cooldowns” below).
Post-Boss Upgrade Options:
After defeating a boss, you are presented with the boss’s four abilities (one for each slot). You then choose one of the following options:

Replace: Swap your current ability in a given slot with the boss’s ability from that slot.
Upgrade: If the boss’s ability matches one you already have (by name), you may upgrade that ability to a higher level.
Note: Upgrades are temporary; they remain only for the duration of the run.
Skip Upgrade & Heal: Forego any ability change to actively heal—restore up to 2 missing HP (if you’re missing only 1 HP, only 1 is restored).
There is no additional healing on entering the next lobby.

6. Run Progression
Run Flow:

After each boss victory, you proceed to a new lobby with three new boss doors.
The run continues until you defeat the 10th boss.
After the 10th Boss:

You may choose to enter Endless Mode (with increased difficulty) or return to the Main Menu.
Temporary Upgrades: Any ability upgrades or replacements obtained during the run are lost once the run ends.
Hero Unlocks:

Pawn: Available by default.
Rook: Unlock by completing 1 run with Pawn (i.e., defeat the 10th boss while using Pawn).
Bishop: Unlock by completing 5 runs (each run must be completed, regardless of which hero is used).
Knight: Unlock by completing 7 runs.
Queen: Unlock by completing 1 run with each character (excluding King).
King: Unlock by completing 2 runs with each character (excluding King).
7. Endless Mode
Activation: After defeating the 10th boss.
Difficulty: Difficulty scaling is accelerated (detailed below).
Note: Temporary ability upgrades and healing decisions carry over as normal during Endless Mode, but they reset when a run ends.
Turn-Based Combat & Movement
Turn Structure & Cooldowns
Rounds:

Each round comprises a Player Turn followed by a Boss Turn.
The Player always takes the first action.
Actions:

Movement: Moving one tile (or using a movement ability) counts as one action.
Ability Use: Using any ability counts as one action.
Cooldowns:

Each ability has a cooldown measured in rounds.
For example, if you use an ability with a 3-round cooldown on Round 1, it will be available again at the start of Round 4.
Both the player’s and boss’s turns count toward reducing cooldowns.
Grid & Pillar Generation
Arena Size:

Each boss arena is generated on a grid ranging in size from 3×3 to 9×9 (the first arena is always 5×5).
Pillar Placement:

Pillars serve as obstacles.
Path Guarantee: Pillars are placed such that there is always at least one unobstructed path between the player (starting at the center bottom tile) and the boss (starting at the center top tile).
Pillars are never placed on the top or bottom rows to maintain clear starting positions.
Tile-Based Movement
Movement Rules:
Movement occurs along a grid of tiles.
Visual Indicators:
Green Border: Valid move.
Red Border: Invalid (blocked or out of range).
Blue Border: Tiles valid for Movement Ability actions.
Obstacles:
For heroes with ranged movement (Rook, Bishop, Queen), pillars block movement beyond their location.
The Knight can jump over pillars but may not land on a tile containing a pillar.
Boss AI
Each boss follows one of three behavioral profiles:

Aggressive:

Closes the distance quickly and uses high-damage melee or short-range attacks.
Defensive:

Maintains distance, uses pushback or pillars for cover, and may activate defensive abilities.
Opportunistic:

Prioritizes its strongest available attack; if that ability is on cooldown or the target is out of range, it falls back on weaker or movement-based actions.
Note: The boss does not telegraph its next move. Instead, its actions are determined in real time based on its behavior profile and current battlefield conditions.

Abilities
Damage values are measured in HP, and cooldowns are in rounds. All ability upgrades during a run are temporary and revert once the run ends.

Primary Abilities
Shotgun

Fires three projectiles in a cone (one straight, two diagonally).
Each projectile deals 1 damage.
Cooldown: 3 rounds.
Projectiles stop upon colliding with an enemy, pillar, or map boundary.
Sniper

Fires a single, straight projectile.
Deals 2 damage.
Cooldown: 2 rounds.
Projectile stops upon contact with an enemy, pillar, or boundary.
Three Round Burst

Fires three consecutive projectiles in a straight line from the same origin.

Cooldown: 4 rounds.
Even if a pillar or wall is immediately in front, all projectiles are spawned (they will instantly collide if blocked).
Musket

Fires a single, straight projectile that deals 2 damage.
Cooldown: 2 rounds.
Chain Reaction:
On hit, the target is pushed 1 tile backward.
If there is a pillar immediately behind the target, the target bounces off and takes an additional 1 damage.
If another enemy occupies that tile, that enemy takes 1 extra damage as well, and the original target suffers an extra 1 damage too.
The chain reaction halts if a pillar is encountered (the secondary enemy is not pushed).
Secondary Abilities

Cooldown: 2 rounds.
Whip

Cooldown: 3 rounds.
Boomerang

Thrown in a counterclockwise arc, it affects the 8 tiles immediately surrounding the player (forming a ring).
Deals 1 damage to each enemy within those tiles.
The boomerang follows a fixed path around the ring and continues unless stopped by a pillar or the map edge.
It does not travel to tiles behind the boss relative to the player’s facing direction.
Grappling Hook

A context-based ability that always targets the furthest unobstructed tile in the chosen direction.
When no enemy is encountered: Pulls the player to that furthest tile.
If an enemy is in the hook’s path: Pulls the enemy to the tile immediately adjacent to the player.
If a pillar is encountered: Pulls the player to the tile just before the pillar.
Deals 2 damage upon use.
Cooldown: 3 rounds.

Characters & Movement Abilities

Pawn:

Moves 2 tiles horizontally or vertically.
Deals 1 damage when landing on an enemy.
Bishop:

Moves diagonally across any number of unobstructed tiles.
Deals 1 damage when landing on an enemy.
Rook:

Knight:

Moves in an “L” shape (2 tiles in one direction then 1 tile perpendicular).

Deals 1 damage upon contact.
Queen:

Moves in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) over unobstructed tiles.
Deals 2 damage on contact.
King:

Health & Meta Progression
HP:

Damage is measured in HP; each point of damage reduces your HP by 1.
Temporary Ability Upgrades:

Upgrades obtained during a run (via the post-boss upgrade options) are temporary.
Once a run is completed, all abilities revert to their base levels.
Difficulty Scaling
Regular Runs (Boss Fights 1–10)
Scaling Formula:
For the nth boss, use the formula:
Base HP: 10 + (n – 1) × Increment
Base Damage: Scales proportionally based on the same Increment.
Increment: A balancing constant determined during playtesting (for example, if Increment = 2, then Boss #3 has 10 + 2×2 = 14 HP).
Endless Mode (Boss Fights 11+)
Accelerated Scaling:
Beginning with Boss #11, each new boss receives an additional bonus of +2 × Increment (instead of +1 × Increment) to both HP and damage.
This doubled rate ensures a progressively steeper difficulty curve.
